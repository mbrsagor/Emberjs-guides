###### What is Class?

> Ans: `Class` is a blueprint for creating objects.

```java
class Sagor{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello Sagor");
    }
  }
```

###### What is Object?

> Ans: `Object` is a real data in class or `Object` is an instance of a class.

```java
Sagor ReferenceVariable = new Sagor();
```

###### What is Inheritance?

> Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class. Hence, inheritance facilitates Reusability and is an important concept of OOPs.

```java
class MbrSagor extends Sagor {
  // body of the class
}
```

###### What is Polymorphism?

> The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.
