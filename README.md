# Java OOP

> Java OOP concepts.

There are four main OOP concepts in Java. OOP concepts in Java are the main ideas behind Javaâ€™s Object Oriented Programming.

### Table of contents:

- OOP
- Class
- Object
- Constructor
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Interface

###### What is Class?

> Ans: `Class` is a blueprint for creating objects.

```java
class Sagor{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello Sagor");
    }
  }
```

###### What is Object?

> Ans: `Object` is a real data in class or `Object` is an instance of a class.

```java
Sagor ReferenceVariable = new Sagor();
```

###### What is Inheritance?

> Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class. Hence, inheritance facilitates Reusability and is an important concept of OOPs.

```java
class MbrSagor extends Sagor {
  // body of the class
}
```

###### What is Polymorphism?

> The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.

###### What is Interface?
```java
// Interface
interface Animal {
  public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}

// Pig "implements" the Animal interface
class Pig implements Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
  public void sleep() {
    // The body of sleep() is provided here
    System.out.println("Zzz");
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Pig myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
    myPig.animalSound();
    myPig.sleep();
  }
}
```
